In this individual project, I wrote R codes to conduct Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) in order to test for any difference in the average attendance of the three divisions (North, South, and West) for the 14 teams in the baseball league, and to conduct multiple comparison procedures (Fisher LSD) to determine where the differences among the means occur. I also wrote codes to do the assumption test to ensure that three assumptions required to use ANOVA are not violated. 

I concluded my analysis with a written report, the output of my R codes and the description of my output are also included in the report. The sample dataset Triple A was used to conduct ANOVA and Fisher LSD. 

The main statistical objective of my project is to determine if the average attendance for the three divisons are the same or not, and if they are not the same, then I would need to dive deeper into each division to see where the differences occur by using Fisher LSD so that the management team can rearrange 14 teams into different divisions to improve attendance rate.
